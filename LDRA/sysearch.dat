  0 This data file determines how static analysis acts with respect to #include statements
  0 found in the source code.
  0 This will affect both the analysis results and the contents of the instrumented source file.
  0
  0 Included files can be searched for and expanded during analysis,
  0 or the #include statement can be left in place. Type 301 records (see below) allow
  0 specific include statements to be removed from the instrumented code.
  0
  0 Place entries in the same position as this comment with the last digit of the identifier
  0 (1, 301 etc.) replacing 0. For example, replacing 0 with 1 in the following line would
  0 make this into a search directory (see Type 1 below):
  0 e:\source\include\
  0
  0 Any lines with an identifier 0 are included as comments.
  0 This is an automatically generated file and comments can be overwritten.
  0
  0 Type 1   - full or relative directory name, for example:
  0              1 e:\source\include\
  0            Can incorporate environment variables in the form $(ENVDIR), for example:
  0              1 $(ENVDIR)\include\
  0            Directory to search for include files to be expanded during static analysis.
  0
  0            It is not generally appropriate to add search paths for standard system/compiler
  0            include directories.
  0
  0            The first 3 paths specified can be made available through the $(SysIncludeEnv)
  0            macro as system include paths.
  0            This macro can be used with, for example, an INCLUDE environment string in
  0            the [<compiler> Build Environment] section of Testbed.ini.

  0 Type 2   - full or relative directory names,
  0            which are added to the $(Includedirs) macro but not expanded during static analysis for example:
  0              2 e:\thirdparty\include\
  0            Can incorporate environment variables in the form $(ENVDIR), for example:
  0              2 $(THIRDPARTY)\include\
  0            Path to be added to the $(Includedirs) macro for example in build commands.
  0
  0            This should generally contain search paths for standard system/compiler
  0            include directories.

  0            200 $(ENVDIR)\include\compiler_A.h
  0
  0            Include file specified will only be expanded if found in this location.
  0            Path also becomes a general search path as described by Type 1 above.
  0            Entries of this type are often automatically added when loading a
  0            compiler project file.

  0
  0            Indicates an include file to be inserted at the top of reformatted source code.
  0            Can be used, for example, where gcc command line qualifier -include
  0            (or equivalent) is used.

  0 Type 300 - short file name, for example:
  0            300 user_file.h
